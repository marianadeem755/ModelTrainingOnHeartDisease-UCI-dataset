# Heart Disease UCI Dataset Prediction and Analysis

This notebook analyzes the Heart Disease UCI dataset using various machine learning classifiers and evaluates their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It also visualizes the results for better understanding.

## Objectives
- Train and evaluate machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) on the Heart Disease UCI dataset.
- Compare the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the results using bar plots.

## Dataset
The notebook uses the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which contains information about patients and their likelihood of having heart disease based on various medical attributes.

## Visualizations
The notebook generates bar plots to compare the performance metrics of different classifiers:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`
- `xgboost`

## Results
The notebook compares the performance of three classifiers:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

Each classifier's metrics are visualized in bar plots for easy comparison.
